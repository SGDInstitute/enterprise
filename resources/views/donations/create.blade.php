                <p>For twenty-five years, MBLGTACC has brought together students from around the United States for a
                    few days each year to learn and grow through the knowledge and experiences of others. We are
                    dedicated to ensuring that the history of the conference carries forward to touch countless
                    lives in the next quarter century.</p>
                <p>And we will do more. For the first time, this student movement to build queer success in the
                    Midwest is taking the principles of MBLGTACC beyond the three-day event.</p>
                <p>Your support will mean two important things.</p>
                <p><strong>First</strong>, all of this work will be possible. As a non-profit organization with an
                    all-volunteer staff, all gifts to the Institute will go directly toward programming, resources,
                    and operations that support students.</p>
                <p><strong>Second</strong>, youâ€™ll be advancing our commitment to economic justice. We pledge to
                    make our programs accessible to all students and young leaders regardless of their financial
                    means. We'll limit costs for participation and materials, and make additional support available
                    to those with limited access to resources. Your support turns this commitment into action.
