    <p class="mb-4 dark:text-gray-200">On this page you can manage your products.</p>

    <p class="mb-4 dark:text-gray-200">Each product has multiple builds, think of each build as a revision of the product. For instance, whenever a module is published from Voltage Module Designer, a new build is created for that product.</p>

    <p class="mb-4 dark:text-gray-200">Every time a new build for a product is created, it will need to be submitted and approved before you'll be able to publish it.</p>
