            Checking in is like checking in for a flight and will be available about 24 hours before the event starts.
            Once you check yourself in, we'll get busy preparing your namebadge and swag.

        <p>
            You can only check yourself in. This is so everyone coming knows how to access their account, and can make
            sure their personal information is correct.
