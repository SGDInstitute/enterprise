Hello,

Thank you again for submitting your workshop for consideration by MBLGTACC organizers for our 31st annual conference this November. We regret to inform you that your submission was not selected for the conference this year.

We received nearly twice as many submissions as last year showcasing the incredible ideas of our communities and had to make difficult decisions to fill our limited slots.

We want our submission process to be a learning experience for young LGBTQ+ folks interested in sharing their brilliance and knowledge with others. If you would like feedback on your submission, you can contact [roze@sgdinstitute.org](mailto:roze@sgdinstitute.org) for suggestions and encouragement on  future submissions.

Watch [this video](https://mblgtacc.org/message-to-aspiring-presenters) from director of programs R.B. Brooks about additional ways you can plug into the conference experience and a personal thanks for your support of MBLGTACC 2023 through the submission process.

Thanks,<br>
