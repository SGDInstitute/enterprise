# Hello and congratulations!

We’re thrilled to share that your workshop has been accepted for MBLGTACC 2023!

Watch [this video](https://mblgtacc.org/special-message-presenters) from our director of programs, R.B. Brooks for a personal message on being selected.

We’re excited to work with you and other MBLGTACC presenters, and are here to support you in being as prepared and confident as possible for conference weekend. As we move forward together, we ask that presenters adhere to our presenter guidelines:

# Presenter guidelines

## Communication
We will send email updates and important information using the address you provided in your workshop submission. Please add [hello@mblgtacc.org](mailto:hello@mblgtacc.org) and [hello@sgdinstitute.org](mailto:hello@sgdinstitute.org) to your email client’s contact or safe contacts list. Please also be attentive to your email and be mindful of any communicated due dates.

## Accessibility
We trust presenters to aid us in curating an accessible environment for all attendees. We will provide as much guidance and support as possible to equip presenters with accessibility tools for their workshops. This is not an exhaustive list, but we would like to emphasize these simple ways to enhance the accessibility of your workshop:

- Use Google Slides to build your presentation and check for color contrast and readability. Check out [IT Accessibility: Google Slides](https://accessibility.oit.ncsu.edu/google-slides/m) for more info on accessible slides.
- Always use a microphone while presenting. Each workshop room is equipped with a microphone. Also, repeat any attendee questions into the microphone for those who may have missed it.
- If you’re using Google Slides, enable the captions function
- If you’re using slides or images, describe the content while presenting. For example, “This photo shows five people laughing” or “This is the Midwest Institute logo”
- If there is text on the screen, read it out loud. And be mindful of the font size for all text in your presentation materials. Fancy fonts or text that is too small can be difficult to process.

We welcome additional recommendations you have discovered that we could share out to all presenters.

## Preparedness

MBLGTACC is a stepping stone for queer and trans presenters who use their experience of presenting to launch into careers in education, public speaking, entertainment, community organizing, and more! We want to support you in feeling confident, comfortable and prepared to present your exciting workshop idea.

**In mid-September**, we’ll provide more details about a presenter orientation hosted via Zoom. That will be an opportunity for you to ask questions as you put the finishing touches on your workshop materials.

We’ll be requesting digital copies of presentation materials (ex: presentation slides, handouts, worksheets, video clips, etc) **by October 20**. Presentation content collected will only be used for internal purposes such as reviewing content for compliance with the Code for Inclusion. More details about this process will be provided closer to the submission deadline.
